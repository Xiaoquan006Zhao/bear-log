<ul>
<li>Our strategy, therefore, must be guided by two principal considerations: the need for <mark class="highlighted">maximum speed</mark> in the transi­tional phase, and the need to <mark class="highlighted">neutralize fully the forces</mark> which could oppose us both before and immediately after the coup.</li>
<li><b>The need for maximum speed means that the many separate operations of the coup must be carried out almost simultaneously</b>
<ul>
<li>This in turn requires a large number of people. Therefore, assuming that we start the planning of the coup with only a small group of political associates, most of the personnel we will need must be recruited</li>
<li>Further, our recruits must have the training and equipment that will enable them to take swift and determined action. There will usually be only one source of such recruits: the armed forces of the state itself
<ul>
<li>Militia is not good because it needs money, freedom to do so, raise nationalist reaction on the other side of the majority peoples, and most likely will lose to national army</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>In dealing with the armed forces, the police, and the security services, we will have to subvert some forces while neutralizing the rest</b>; in the case of the political forces the objective will be limited to their neutralization
<ul>
<li>Because of their capability for direct intervention, the armed forces and the other means of coercion of the state must be fully neutralized <b>before</b> the actual coup starts</li>
<li>The “political” forces can usually be dealt with immediately <b>after</b> the coup.
<ul>
<li>In some situations, however, the political forces can also have an immediate impact on the course of events and must, therefore, be treated on the same basis as the means of coercion of the state
<ul>
<li>Railroads, Shops, Religious and ethnic leaders …</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><br>
<h2 id='Neutralizing the Defense of the State'>Neutralizing the Defense of the State</h2><ul>
<li>One of the outstanding features of modern states is their <b>extensive and diversified security system</b>
<ul>
<li>The modern army or security force is usually too large to be a coherent social unit bound by traditional loyalties; the need for technically minded personnel has broken the barriers that often limited re­cruitment to particular social groups within each country.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The fact that the personnel of the state security system is both numerous and diverse means that we, the planners of the coup, will be able to infiltrate the system.
<ul>
<li>In doing so, we will have the dual task of turning a few of its com­ponet units into active participants of the coup, while neutralizing the others. This does not mean that we have to fight them, but merely that we have to prevent their possible intervention against us for the limited time-span of the coup.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The effectiveness of modern soldiers, with their rapid transport, reliable communications, and efficient weapons, means that even /one/single formation loyal to the regime could intervene and defeat the coup</li>
</ul><br>
<h2 id='Neutralizing the Armed Forces'>Neutralizing the Armed Forces</h2><ul>
<li>Armies are divided into certain traditional formations which vary from country to country, such as divisions, brigades, regiments, battalions, companies, platoons. Be­yond this theoretical structure, however, <b>the focus of decision-making and <mark class="highlighted">the real organizational framework</mark> is usually concentrated at one or two particular levels</b></li>
<li>When we have determined which is the true operational echelon in the various formations of the country concerned, we can go on to the next stage: <mark class="highlighted">identifying which forma­tions have the capability to intervene—for or against the coup</mark>
<ul>
<li>We shall follow two main criteria: <b>the nature of the unit concerned</b>, and <b>the location of the particular unit</b></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><mark class="highlighted">The forces relevant to a coup are those whose locations and/or equipment enables them to intervene in its locale (usually the capital city) within the 12-24-hour time-span which precedes the establishment of its control over the machinery of government</mark></li>
</ul><br>
<h3 id='Infiltrating the Armed Forces: Unit'>Infiltrating the Armed Forces: Unit</h3><ul>
<li>Identify the “key” <b>individuals</b> within each particu­lar unit
<ul>
<li><mark class="highlighted">“Technicians”</mark> and those who coordinate them, the <mark class="highlighted">“lead­ers”</mark>
<ul>
<li>As we have already determined which is the “operational” echelon within each particular formation and thus implicitly identified the “leaders”</li>
<li>Who the technicians are will depend on the nature of the organization and the task to be carried out.
<ul>
<li>If, for example, during the course of the coup the govern­ment calls on the help of force (c) in our notional Table 2, its arrival in the capital could be prevented with the cooperation of just one of these groups
<ul>
<li>The staff oper­ating the communication system between   the political lead­ership and force (c)</li>
<li>The pilots and/or ground staff of the air transport squadron</li>
<li>The guard force at the airport(s)</li>
<li>The control-tower personnel at either air­ port, especially in difficult flying conditions</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This indicates that insofar as we are trying to neutralize a formation of the armed forces, we should do so through the cooperation of <b>technicians rather than leaders</b>, because the former are both <b>more effective individually and easier (and safer) to recruit</b></li>
<li>The second rule is that we should, other things being equal, choose for neutralization those units which have <b>the most complex organization</b>, while choosing the simplest ones for incorporation. This will both reduce our vulnerability from a sudden defection and minimize the total number of people that must be ulti­mately recruited (due to the tight dependence between a complex organization)</li>

<li>What we must <mark class="highlighted">not</mark> do is to rely on battalion No. 2 only, because the defection from our cause of even a few of its “technicians” would have dramatic consequences (too many links of the technical chain)</li>
</ul><br>
<h3 id='Infiltrating the Armed Forces: Officer'>Infiltrating the Armed Forces: Officer</h3><ul>
<li><b>If we go up to an army officer and ask him to join in a projected coup</b>, he will be faced—unless he is a total loyal­ist— with a set of options, offering both dangers and op­portunities
<ul>
<li>The proposition could be a “plant” of the security au­thorities to determine his loyalty to the regime</li>
<li>The prop­osition could be genuine, but part of an insecure and in­ efficient plot</li>
<li>The proposition could come from a team that has every chance of success</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Should the proposal be a “plant,” accepting it could lose him his job and much more, while reporting it would gain him the rewards of loyalty. Should it be a genuine pro­posal he has the uncertain prospect of benefiting after a coup, as against the certain prospect of benefiting immedi­ately from reporting it. <mark class="highlighted">The natural thing for him to do, therefore, is to report it</mark></li>
<li><b>The whole technique of the approach is designed to de­ feat this logic</b>
<ul>
<li>Apart from <b>the rewards of being part of a successful coup</b> (which can be portrayed as being signifi­cantly greater than the rewards of loyalty) there is another factor which operates in our favor.</li>
<li>This is that <b>the person to whom an approach is reported may himself  be a sup­porter of the coup</b></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But, hopefully, our potential recruits will be motivated by some considerations beyond greed and fear, with other interests and affiliations entering their choice: links of friendship with the planners of the coup and a shared political outlook will be important, but usually the crucial considerations will be family, clan, and <b>ethnic</b> links with those planning the coup
<ul>
<li>In fact, all over Eastern Europe the old conflicts are just below the surface, and the new “socialist-national” policies are in­evitably reviving them</li>
<li>In Rumania almost half a million Germans and a million and a half Hungarians feel that they are not getting a fair deal</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><mark class="highlighted">We will therefore make the fullest use of the “ ethnic matrix” without, however, aligning our coup with any par­ticular ethnic faction</mark>
<ul>
<li>In terms of petty tactics, we will match each potential recruit with a recruiter who shares his affiliation, and, if necessary, the image of the coup will be presented in a similar vein</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <b>ideological outlook</b> of the potential recruit will also be im­portant. As far as we are concerned, combining all ranges of the political spectrum against a right or left extreme will give the most suitable political “cover” to our coup
<ul>
<li>The Quassem regime in Iraq, which lasted for five years as a pure balancing act, was finally brought down in 1963 when the moderate nationalist Aref (Abdel Salam) per­suaded all political factions, from left-wing Ba’ath to right- wing conservatives, to combine against the supposed Com­munist penetration in the government</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Finding out the <b>ethnic group</b> to which a particular officer belongs is relatively easy; finding out what is his <b>political outlook</b> is rather more difficult. But the hardest thing of all will be to find out if he is <b>personally alienated</b> from the higher military leadership
<ul>
<li>Only the family and the closest friends of an officer will know whether he feels that his superiors are treating him unfairly, or running things badly, to the extent that he would welcome a radical change in the whole set-up. Unless we have a direct line to the in­dividual concerned, we will have to use outside information to determine his inner feelings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A standard intelligence procedure is to follow the career pattern of officers, in order to find out which ones have been <b>passed over for promotion</b>, assuming—other things being equal— that they will make good prospects for re­cruitment
<ul>
<li>In many countries, promotions within the armed forces are announced in <b>official gazettes</b>, and start­ ing from a particular class at the military academy, one can follow the career of each officer from their graduation to the present</li>
<li>In some countries, where promotions are not published (for security reasons), one can carry out the exercise by using back copies of the <b>telephone directory</b> where their names will be printed along with their changing ranks.</li>
<li>Where, as in the Soviet Union, neither telephone directories nor official gazettes are good sources of information, we could use <b>more desperate expedients</b>: getting an old boy from the relevant years to circulate proposals for a reunion, or building up mini-biographies from personal acquaintances</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><mark class="highlighted">Ethnic affiliation, political outlook, and career patterns will all serve as guides to the likely reaction of the potential recruit when the approach is made</mark></li>
<li>There are, however, two points that we have to bear in mind, the first <b>organiza­tional</b>, and the second <b>deeply human (unpredictability)</b>
<ul>
<li>While alienated per­sonnel will make good recruits, we must remember that we need people who will not only cooperate personally, as in the case of the technicians, but <b>also bring the units they command over to the coup</b>. Thus, while the leaders we recruit could (and should) be estranged from the superior hierarchy, they must <b>not be “outsider” figures who are not trusted by their fellow officers and men</b>
<ul>
<li>There will often be a danger of attracting the inefficient, the unpopular, the corrupt, as well as the disaffected</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bearing in mind the individuality of our prospective re­cruits, we can nevertheless use the information we have collected to <b>rank the leaders in terms of their probable response to our criteria</b> (each factor will differ from one environment to another)
<ul>
<li>In Latin America, for ex­ ample, social background would also have to be added, while in Western Europe and North America political allegiance would be paramount— ethnic affiliation would be of little importance, but social background would carry some weight.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><br>
<p><img src='F2E72DC1-8F66-479B-AB21-92D139AAD851.png'></p><ul>
<li>Once we have repeated the procedure followed in the case of battalion No. 1 and we have covered all the other formations of the armed forces (or at any rate those with an effective intervention capability), we will know the overall recruitment prospects of each unit, and within them, of each individual.
<ul>
<li>We will never be able to achieve a 100 percent coverage; in some cases, where the armed forces are very large in relation to our resources, or fre­quently redeployed, our coverage may be very incomplete. This will not matter greatly if the “unknown” units can be neutralized technically (we will also be able physically to isolate those units which appear on the scene unex­pectedly and those which we have not been able to in­ filtrate at all)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><br>
<h3 id='Infiltrating the Armed Forces: Approach the Officer'>Infiltrating the Armed Forces: Approach the Officer</h3><ul>
<li><b>The most dangerous person to approach will be the first</b> in each particular formation, because until we have his cooperation we will not have a really intimate source of information about the unit and its members.</li>
<li>Our first recruit must, therefore, be a long-standing member of that particular formation and, if at all possible, he must be a senior officer—or even the commander.</li>
<li>Once we have chosen our man, the first step will be to arrange a meeting and to “sound” him out in vague and generalized terms about the “possibilities of achieving political reform”</li>
<li><b>These soundings must be conducted by a man, or men, who fulfills certain exacting qualifications: he or she must be a trusted associate of high caliber without, however, being in the inner group planning the coup</b> In other words he must be both valuable and expendable</li>
<li>Once the potential recruit has been brought to the state when the possibility of a coup has been openly discussed, he should be told three things about the coup:
<ul>
<li>The political aim</li>
<li>That we have already “ recruited” other individuals and units</li>
<li>The nature of the task that he will be asked to perform.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Everything we say, or arrange to be said, to the potential recruit will have to be studied carefully, and we will work on the assumption that every recruit may be a “double” working for the security services.</li>
<li>We will not, of course, identify our coup with any particular party (whose policies would be known) nor with any political faction (whose leading personalities will be known)</li>
<li>We will, instead, state the aim of the coup in terms of a <b>political attitude</b> rather than in terms of pol­icies or personalities, because the latter are necessarily more specific and therefore liable to specific opposition.
<ul>
<li>The attitude which we will project will have to be cal­culated carefully: it should reflect the preoccupations of the target country, implying a solution to the problems which are felt to exist, and in form it must reflect the general political beliefs of the majority of its people.
<ul>
<li>Thus, in Britain, we could speak of “the need for more business­ like government”—one can even imply (whether truth­ fully or not) that the coup is linked with prominent public figures such as newspaper proprietors, big businessmen, or the chairman of a nationalized industry.</li>
<li>In Latin America the attitude presented may, for example, imply that the “sacred trust of the armed forces” requires intervention to “clear the mess made by the politicians” in order to achieve “social / national progress, while respecting property rights / individual rights.”</li>
<li>If the pre-coup government is itself the product of a seizure of power, then the aims of the coup can be pre­sented purely in terms of restoring “normal political life,” or, if we are “front” leftists, we can speak about “the need to restore democracy’</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once the idea of the coup has gained a measure of acceptance in the mind of our potential recruit, we should define the coup in terms of his role within it. This will not imply that we will reveal any of the operational detail, but we should make it quite clear that:
<ul>
<li>His role will be limited to a few specific actions</li>
<li>Almost everybody in his unit is already with us</li>
<li>Therefore his role will be a safe one</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When, and only when, the recruit becomes actual, rather than potential, we can reveal to him the nature of his actual task. This will be described in the greatest possible detail, but not so as to enable the recruit to work out the implications of the task he is asked to perform.</li>
<li>After the approach and persuasion of the “key” individ­uals has begun to give its results (help us recruit others), we will be able to identify the units which will eventually be used as active partici­pants in the coup. These will be a small part of the armed forces as a whole but, hopefully, the only part that will be able to play an active role at the time and place of the coup. We will concentrate our further efforts on them be­ cause their infiltration in depth will be of value to us, whereas the “over-neutralization” of the other forces will merely involve further risk</li>
</ul><br>
<h2 id='Neutralizing the Police'>Neutralizing the Police</h2><ul>
<li>Police forces are shaped by the social and political conditions of the society they serve and are there­ fore very diverse</li>
<li>If the British police system can be said to be divided into largely <b>territorial</b> units, and the French one into largely <b>functional</b> ones, in the United States the division is largely <b>constitutional</b>.
<ul>
<li>Except for the specialized work of the police agencies attached to various departments of the federal government, only the FBI has a nation-wide juris­diction, and then only for certain crimes legally defined as "federal."</li>
<li>Most ordinary police work is carried out by purely independent local forces maintained at the munici­pal, county, or state level.</li>
<li>The fragmentation of the sys­tem means that the police as such would have a very limited intervention potential, in spite of its extensive stock of weaponry and communication equipment</li>
<li>There is, of course, the National Guard, but this has not so far been organized in a manner that would give it a real intervention capability, as was shown by the events of the summer of 1967 when the guard failed to perform effi­ciently, even against untrained civilians</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The first step in our neutralization of these forces is to establish <b>the size, deployment, and organization</b> of the paramilitary police
<ul>
<li>This is usually easier than in the case of the army because, unlike the latter, paramilitary forces are usually stationed in permanent barracks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Next we will try to find out their <b>degree of attachment to the present regime</b>
<ul>
<li>But this will not involve the sort of study in depth we made of the army, and it will only be a matter of finding out about their corporate, rather than individual, outlook
<ul>
<li>The mentality of the paramilitary police may be “ bureaucratic,” i.e. concerned with jobs and careers— as in the case of the Italian Pubblica Sicurezza and its Celere paramilitary units; if this is the case, a minimal degree of intervention can be expected</li>
<li>On the other hand, their mentality may be parallel to that of the army, i.e. concerned with loyalty and honor (as well as jobs and careers), or reflect a political association, as in the case of the KBG or Duvalier’s Ton Ton Macoutes</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the equipment, deployment, and mentality of the paramilitary police are such as to make them an effective intervention force we will have to control them in the same manner as the “hard-core” loyalist forces of the army. (The ways and means of this forcible isolation will be discussed in Chapter 5)</li>
<li>Recruiting our forces among the police will almost always be more difficult than in the army
<ul>
<li>The lower level of (automatic) dis­cipline will mean that recruiting an officer may not bring over “his" men as well</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All these factors point the same way: the low degree of intervention capability— for, as well as against, us— and the difficulty of incorporation both indicate that while the army should be penetrated the police forces can be dealt with— defensively— after the coup</li>
</ul><br>
<h2 id='Intelligence Service'>Intelligence Service</h2><ul>
<li>The security agencies of our target country will be nu­merically the smallest of the professional defenses of the state, but often also the most dangerous. Unlike the armed forces and the police, the security agencies will be actively trying to identify and defeat threats posed by groups such as ours; unlike the armed forces and police, their organiza­tions, deployment, and personnel cannot usually be stud­ied from the outside, and even their existence may not be known to us.</li>
<li>Almost every state has some sort of “secret service.” Many have several such organizations which operate both within and outside the national territory, and which we have so far described with the blanket term “security agencies.”</li>
<li><mark class="highlighted">Our first task is to try to identify them more precisely</mark></li>
<li>We may— if we fail to preserve our security position— come into contact with (a) the police agency, such as Special Branch in Britain or the FBI in the U.S.A., (b) the separate ministerial body, or (c) the military agencies
<ul>
<li>Much of our planning and infiltration work will be indistinguishable from that which could be carried out by a foreign intelligence service and it will therefore enter into the territory of the counter­ intelligence agencies</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The counterespionage function is the most subtle and sophisticated of all the func­tions. It covers the deliberate contact with opposition in­telligence services, in order to feed them with “disinforma­tion” or to disrupt their organization
<ul>
<li>It is unlikely that more than one agency carries out this work because it re­ quires an extremely precise control over operations</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Our behavior in the midst of this bureaucratic jungle will be <b>purely defensive</b>, unless we have a “direct line” to one or another of the security agencies.
<ul>
<li>If that is the case, the security agency concerned would provide an ideal “cover” for all our activities.</li>
<li>Failing such a fortunate coin­cidence, we will <mark class="highlighted">not</mark> try to create a “direct line” by infiltrat­ing any security service, because if we do so there will be the very great danger that they will use any contact in order to infiltrate us.</li>
<li>This is a standard procedure for the security services to follow, and the elementary defensive techniques used when infiltrating the armed forces (cut­ outs, one-way communication, etc.) will probably fail to work in their case.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In order to run a secure operation we will follow rules which derive from the basic assumption that <mark class="highlighted">all informa­tion about our activities is a source of danger as soon as it exists outside the minds of our inner group</mark>. From this all the standard procedures emerge:
<ul>
<li>No information to be communicated except verbally</li>
<li>No information to be communicated except on a “need-to-know” basis</li>
<li>All communication links from inner to affiliated mem­bers to be on a one-way basis</li>
<li>No activity to be carried out by an inner member if an outer member can do the job</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>These rules are simple and well known; the problem is to keep to them under the pressure of work and the emo­tions which it generates</li>
<li>The most sensitive of our activities will be the approach and persuasion of new affiliates to the coup, and the nature of the security agencies can add an extra measure of danger: in many countries some of the security services are hidden within totally unexciting administrative bodies.</li>
<li><b>The department-within-a-department system is deliberate</b>
<ul>
<li>We may therefore unwittingly try to infiltrate a “safe" department and discover that we are dealing with a security agency</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><mark class="highlighted">It must not be thought that our entire operation will automatically collapse if it is penetrated by a security agency</mark>
<ul>
<li>If we have followed the <b>security procedures</b> the chances are that only a small part of our total effort will be identified, and therefore its ultimate purpose may not be discovered</li>
<li>Even if it is discovered that a coup is being planned, the security agency may wait before taking any action, in order to capture all the planners— and this could be <b>too late</b>
<ul>
<li>As soon as our teams are on the road, actually executing the coup, it will be too late for the security services to oppose us on the “information" side, while their fighting power will usually be unimportant as compared to the army units we have incorporated</li>
