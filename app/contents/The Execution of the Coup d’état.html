<ul>
<li>The active stage takes place in one short period of time and forces held back today will be useless tomorrow</li>
<li>The fact that the coup has practically no time dimension means that we will rarely be able to correct errors made during its execution</li>
<li>Our teams will emerge from their bases and proceed to seize their designated targets while operating as independ­ent units; their collective purpose and their coordinations will thus remain unknown until it is too late for any effective opposition.</li>
</ul><br>
<h2 id='On the Eve'>On the Eve</h2><ul>
<li>One major task has not been covered in the planning stage: <mark class="highlighted">the forcible isolation of the “hard-core” loyalist forces</mark></li>
<li>Our purpose is not to destroy the loyalist forces militarily (since we will be able to deal with their cadres adminis­tratively after the coup) but merely to <b>immobilize them for a few crucial hours</b></li>
<li>Though we will be on the strategic offensive (in the sense that we are the ones who want to change the situation in general) we will also be on the tactical defensive, and this will give us important <b>technical and psychological advan­tages</b>
<ul>
<li>By using defended roadblocks to isolate the loyalist forces, we will put the onus of initiating any fighting on them: <b>our forces will be content to wait and it will be the loyalist forces which will try to pass through</b></li>
<li>Should a column of loyalist forces arrive at the roadblock, their leaders will be faced by opposite numbers wearing the same uniform, and belonging to the same corporate entity, per­haps even to the same regiment. <b>Both sides will state that they are “obeying orders”</b> but interestingly enough, the “orders” of the leaders of our forces will probably appear more legitimate than those of the leaders of the loyalist troops.
<ul>
<li>Owing to our arrests and our interdiction of the physical facilities, the “legitimate” orders will probably have taken an unusual form
<ul>
<li>The source of the orders to the loyalist troops will probably be somebody other than the appropriate superior in the hierarchy</li>
<li>The method used to convey them will probably be an unusual emergency one</li>
<li>And the actual orders indistinguishable in form from ones which might have been issued by the planners of a coup</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Thus the officers of the loyalist forces may have received orders stating, “Move into the city center, hold the parlia­ment building and the radio station.”
<ul>
<li>The leadership may have added that they would be acting against the forces of a coup but, even so, such orders would have insurrectional undertones.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If, on the other hand, the loyalist units decide to force the roadblock, we will benefit from the <b>tactical advantages of the defensive</b>
<ul>
<li>These include the opportunity of choosing the place (natural obstructions such as bridges and tunnels) and the opportunity of deploying and camouflaging weap­ons and men</li>
<li>In order to make the fullest use of both the psychological and the tactical advantages, the blocking position should have a dual structure: <b>a (largely symbolic) first line</b> composed of some suitable physical obstacle, such as cross-parked heavy vehicles, with a few men bearing “orders” which forbid all passage; beyond this, there will be <b>a second (military) line</b>, much stronger numerically, with weapons and men deployed to repel an eventual assault (the operational detail involved is discussed in Ap­pendix B ). The defenders of the blocking position should inform the incoming loyalist forces that there is such a second line of defense: this should be partly camouflaged and would then serve as a deterrent even if it is numerically weak compared to the opposition, since its real strength will be difficult to ascertain</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><br>
<h2 id='Timing, Sequence, And Security'>Timing, Sequence, And Security</h2><ul>
<li>Ideally, the timing of the coup will be completely <b>flexible</b> so that we can take advantage of any <b>favorable circum­stances</b> which may arise, such as the temporary absence of the leadership from the capital city or the outbreak of some coincidental civil disorders</li>
<li>But <b>unless the coup materializes</b>, there will eventually be a movement of infiltration of the army and police into neutrality or even op­position</li>
<li>Meanwhile, the danger of denunciation will also increase as more and more <b>people become aware that a coup is being planned</b></li>
<li>The timing of the coup will therefore be dictated by the progress of our infiltration of the armed forces and police, and <mark class="highlighted">as soon as a satisfactory degree of penetration is achieved the coup must be executed</mark></li>
<li>we should <b>as­sume as a working hypothesis that we have in fact been infiltrated by the security agency</b> This leads to the general defensive procedures discussed in Chapter 3, but it will also have precise operational implications:
<ul>
<li>Each “team” will be told well in advance what equipment and tactics will be required to seize its particular target, but not the exact designation of the target</li>
<li>Each “team” will only be told its designated target when it actually receives the signal to proceed to its seizure</li>
<li><b>Each “team” will be alerted individually</b>, with only as much advance warning as it requires to prepare for its particular task, instead of a general go-signal for all teams</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><br>
<p><img src='F1AE8A28-AB34-4AAE-8F2A-7A2998315732.png'></p><ul>
<li>But in reality the problem is more complex. It is <b>not a matter of simultaneous arrival at the target but rather of the <mark class="highlighted">simultaneous penetration of the “early-warning system”</mark> maintained by the security agencies of the state</b>
<ul>
<li>If, for example, Team No. 2 has to cross the entire capital city to reach its target, the security agency will probably be alerted as soon as it enters the city, at, say, hour — 2. Thus by the time that Team No. 4 reached its target, the opposi­tion would have had two hours to prepare for its defense.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We must therefore secure
<ul>
<li>The protection of our security position against an internal threat, which is achieved by <b>minimizing “ excess warning time”</b></li>
<li>The protection of our security position against external observation, which is achieved by <b>simultaneous penetration of the capital city area</b></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Both aims will be achieved by <mark class="highlighted">sending the teams into action at a time corresponding to their lead times to the capital-city boundary</mark></li>
</ul><br>

<h2 id='Into Action'>Into Action</h2><ul>
<li>The actual execution of the coup will <b>require many differ­ent qualities</b>
<ul>
<li>Skillful <b>diplomacy</b> at a blocking position con­ fronted by loyalist forces</li>
<li>Instant <b>personnel management</b> at the radio-television station in order to persuade its tech­nical staff to cooperate with us</li>
<li>Considerable <b>tactical abili­ties</b> in the case of targets which are heavily defended</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Our resources will probably be too limited to form fully specialized teams out of the pool of those units and individuals which we have incorporated, but we should nevertheless match broad categories of targets with appropriate teams.</li>
<li>We can distinguish among three such categories of tar­gets and their corresponding teams.</li>
</ul><br>
<h3 id='A-Targets'>A-Targets</h3><ul>
<li>These are the more <mark class="highlighted">heavily guarded facilities</mark> with strict pass control, such as the royal or presidential palace, the central police station, and the army HQ</li>
<li>Partly in order to minimize bloodshed, which could have a destabilizing effect on the situation, and partly in order to reduce the total manpower required, <b>these targets will have to be seized by “sophisticated” teams using a blend of infiltration, diversion, and assault</b></li>
<li>This should not result in much actual combat: when those who guard the target in question are confronted by our extensive preparations, they are unlikely to put up much serious resistance.
<ul>
<li>The fact that our general meas­ures of neutralization have cut off or impeded their con­ tacts with the leadership</li>
<li>The fact that the clear patriotic issues of international warfare will be missing in an internal conflict</li>
<li>The fact that we will make every effort to allow them to give in gracefully will all militate against a prolonged defense</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>These targets will nevertheless indirectly present us with a very serious prob­lem, though it is political rather than military: the forma­tion of the large teams required by these targets will raise the delicate issue of <mark class="highlighted">the coup-within-the-coup</mark>
<ul>
<li>During the active phase of the coup the situation will be confused and extremely unstable, and while the other teams will be too small to tempt their leaders into trying to usurp our con­trol, the operational leaders of the A-teams may well suc­cumb to temptation
<ul>
<li>The man who leads the tanks which have just seized the presidential palace may easily persuade himself that he can also seize power on his own behalf</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It will therefore be necessary to adopt measures to prevent the leaders of these large teams from challenging our position
<ul>
<li>This can some­ times be done by forming the A-teams from many small subunits under the overall command of an inner member of our own group.</li>
<li>Where this is not possible, the A-teams will have to be dispersed into smaller groups assigned to secondary targets as soon as they have fulfilled their primary mission.
<ul>
<li>Thus the possible threat presented by the A-teams will be deflected by applying the energies of their leaders to other tasks</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Matters should be so arranged that they are deprived of their large and unified teams before the transition is made in their minds.</li>
</ul><br>
<h3 id='B-Targets'>B-Targets</h3><ul>
<li>These are the <mark class="highlighted">technical facilities which will not usually be heavily guarded</mark>, and which in any case we want to neutral­ize rather than seize, such as the telephone exchange, the telegraph office, and secondary radio-television stations</li>
<li>Each of these targets will be assigned to <b>a small team whose personnel will include a “technician”</b> whose presence should help to minimize the amount of physical damage resulting from sabotage
<ul>
<li>If it is possible to interdict these targets by minor and external sabotage, the B-team may consist of just one or two technically competent operators.</li>
<li>Even if the actual building has to be entered for a short time, the B-team will still be a small one, but in this case it should be overt and consist of uniformed soldiers or policemen.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><br>
<h3 id='C-Targets'>C-Targets</h3><ul>
<li>These are the <b>individuals we wish to hold in isolation for the duration of the coup</b>
<ul>
<li>In the case of the main leader(s) of the government, the arrests will be subsumed in the seizure of the presidential palace and similar A-targets, and therefore the other C-targets should not present a penetration problem</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The personalities whom we wish to arrest will try to <b>escape or conceal their identity</b></li>
<li>It will therefore be essential to devote our early attentions to these targets so as to ensure that they are seized before they can evade our teams
<ul>
<li>This will usually imply that the C-teams will go into operation marginally earlier than the other teams, and they can do so without breaking the rule of simul­taneous penetration of the “early-warning system, be­cause they should be sufficiently small and dispersed to act covertly</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Because these targets are human they will be inherently more problematic than some of our other objectives; the individuals concerned, apart from escaping or concealing their identity, could also try to <b>subvert the very teams sent to arrest them</b>
<ul>
<li>In the case of particularly charismatic figures, our teams will have to be formed from especially selected personnel; in some cases it may even be necessary to include an inner member of our group. These C-teams will be small, since their task will be a matter of entering a private residence and overpowering one or two guards.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once the individuals which form this group of targets have been arrested, we will have to ensure that they are <b>kept under a secure form of control</b>
<ul>
<li>Our purpose in arresting them is to prevent them from using their influence and/or charisma against us and this can only be achieved if we can insulate them from their public for the whole duration of the coup</li>
<li>Such individuals are often the only casualties of otherwise bloodless coups, because it is often easier to eliminate them, rather than to keep them as captives</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><br>
<h3 id='Other teams'>Other teams</h3><ul>
<li>While the teams are on their way to their respective targets our other allies will also come into action
<ul>
<li>The in­dividuals we have subverted in various parts of the armed forces</li>
<li>Bureaucracy will carry out their limited missions of technical neutralization</li>
<li>The groups assigned to the blocking positions will be moving to take up their planned locations designed to isolate the loyalist forces</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There will be a <mark class="highlighted">signaling problem:</mark> since they are scattered throughout the sensitive parts of the state ap­paratus, it will be difficult to reach them individually</li>
<li>Further, they may include informants of the security agencies because, unlike the personnel of the various teams and blocking forces, they have been recruited as isolated individuals and therefore the mutual surveillance exercised on our behalf in the teams will not operate</li>
<li>Thus it would be dangerous to give them advance warning of the coup and their signal to go into action will have to be our first broadcast on the radio-television station, except in par­ticular cases where the facility to be neutralized requires early attention</li>
</ul><br>
<h3 id='Conflict with loyalist'>Conflict with loyalist</h3><ul>
<li>Our operational control over the various groups co­operating with us will aim at achieving two objectives
<ul>
<li><b>Maximum speed in the execution of their tasks</b></li>
<li><b>The use of the absolute minimum of force</b></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This will be important not only because of the psychological and political factors previously mentioned, but also for a more direct, technical reason: <mark class="highlighted">the external uniformity be­ tween the two sides of the conflict</mark>
<ul>
<li>Our teams will, of course, be nationals of the country in which the coup is being staged, and most of them will be soldiers and police­ men wearing the same uniforms as those of the opposition</li>
<li>This uniformity will give us a measure of protection since the loyalist forces will not readily know who is loyal and who is not</li>
<li>Usually it would be a mistake to prejudice this protective cover by adopting distinctive armbands or other conventional labels, since we will need all the protection we can get</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Thus, as the teams move around the capital city (probably at night) they will probably not be fired upon, unless they open fire first</li>
<li>Further, since our teams have always been kept separate, initially to prevent the penetration of the security agencies, and now to protect our own position within the forces of the coup, there will be a danger of conflict be­ tween our own teams.
<ul>
<li>The confusion we generate in the minds of the opposition could therefore exact a price in confusion within our own ranks; this may have serious consequences unless our forces respect the rule of a minimal and purely defensive use of force.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><br>
<h2 id='Stabilizing'>Stabilizing</h2><ul>
<li>We will be doing this at three different levels
<ul>
<li>Among our own forces, where our aim is to <b>prevent our military or police allies from usurping our leadership</b></li>
<li>Within the <b>state bureaucracy</b>, whose allegiance and coop­eration we wish to secure</li>
<li>With the <b>public at large</b>, whose acceptance we want to gain</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In each case we will be using our leverage within one level in order to control the next one, but each level will also require sepa­rate and particular measures</li>
</ul><br>
<h3 id='Stabilizing Our Own Forces'>Stabilizing Our Own Forces</h3><ul>
<li>Apart from the dispersal countermeasures discussed above, our only effective defense will be to <b>retain full control over all "horizontal” communications</b>, or in other words to remain the only contact between each military leader we have recruited and his colleagues
<ul>
<li>The general security measures we designed to protect ourselves against the penetration of the security agencies will also serve a useful supplementary function: they will prevent the lateral spread of the conspiracy. If our internal security procedures are sufficiently good to prevent all contact between the separate "cells," so that any infiltration by the security agencies is contained, they will also prevent the coordination of this inner opposition</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As soon as we begin to receive the allegiance of military and bureaucratic leaders who were previously outside the conspiracy our leverage with our military and police recruits will increase very substantially.</li>
<li>The problem of re­taining control against such internal threats will therefore be largely short-term</li>
<li>As soon as our position has been established our best policy may be to dispose of our dangerous allies by using the usual polite methods available for the purpose
<ul>
<li>Diplomatic posting abroad</li>
<li>Nominal and/or remote command positions</li>
<li>“Promotions" to less vital parts of the state apparatus.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><br>
<h3 id='Stabilizing The Bureaucracy'>Stabilizing The Bureaucracy</h3><ul>
<li>Our attitude toward the second level, the armed forces and bureaucracy which were not infiltrated before the coup, will <b>depend partly on the degree of control which we have over our own “incorporated” forces</b>
<ul>
<li>If most of the officers of the armed forces or the officials of a ministry have joined the coup, those who have not are hardly likely to be rewarded subsequently by rapid promotion</li>
<li>If the soldiers and bureaucrats realized that the group participating in the coup was in reality quite small, they would also realize the strength of their own position: the fact that they are collectively indispensable to any government</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the period immediately after the coup, how­ ever, they will probably see themselves as isolated individuals whose careers, and even lives, could be in danger. This <b>feeling of insecurity</b> may precipitate two alternative reactions, both extreme
<ul>
<li>They will either step forward to assert their loyalty to the leaders of the coup</li>
<li>Else they will try to foment or join in opposition against us</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Both reactions are undesirable from our point of view.
<ul>
<li>Assertions of loyalty will usually be worthless since they are made by men who have just abandoned their previous, and possibly more legitimate, masters</li>
<li>Opposition will always be dangerous and sometimes disastrous.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><mark class="highlighted">Our policy toward the military and bureaucratic cadres will be to reduce this sense of insecurity</mark>
<ul>
<li><b>We should establish direct communication</b> with as many of the more senior officers and officials as possible to convey one principal idea in a forceful and convincing manner: that the coup will not threaten their positions in the hierarchy and the aims of the coup do not include a reshaping of the existing military or administrative structures.</li>
<li>This requirement will incidentally have <b>technical implications</b> in the planning stage, when <b>the sabotage of the means of communication must be carried out so as to be reversible easily</b></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In dealing with particular army or police officers who control especially important forces or with important bureaucrats, we may well decide to go further, in the sense that an actual exchange of promises of mutual support may take place.
<ul>
<li><b>We should remember that our main strength lies in the fact that only we have a precise idea of the extent of our power</b></li>
<li>It would therefore be unwise to enter into agreements which indicate that we need support urgently; more generally, any information which reveals the limits of our capabilities could threaten our position, which is essentially based on the fact that our inherent weakness is concealed</li>
<li>Again, as in the case of our own incorporated forces, we should make every effort to <b>prevent communication between the cadres of the armed forces and bureaucracy outside our group</b>
<ul>
<li>Such communication would usually be indispensable to those who may seek to stage a counter-coup</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><br>
<h3 id='From Power To Authority: Stabilizing The Masses'>From Power To Authority: Stabilizing The Masses</h3><ul>
<li>Our immediate aim will be to enforce public order, but our long-term objective is to <b>gain the acceptance</b> of the masses so that physical coercion will no longer be needed in order to secure compliance with our orders</li>
<li>Our first measures, to be taken immediately after the active phase of the coup, will be designed to freeze the situation by imposing physical immobility. A total <b>curfew</b>, the interruption of all forms of public transport, the closing of all public buildings and facilities, and the interruption of the telecommunication services will prevent, or at any rate impede, active resistance to us.
<ul>
<li>Organized resistance will be very difficult since there will be no way of inspiring and coordinating our potential opponents</li>
<li>Unorganized resistance on the part of a mob will, on the other hand, be prevented because the people who might form such a mob would have to violate the curfew while acting as individuals, and not many will do this without the protective shelter of anonymity which a crowd provides</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Our second and far more flexible instrument will be our control over the means of <b>mass communications</b>; their importance will be particularly great because the flow of all other information will be affected by our physical controls.
<ul>
<li>Moreover, the confused and dramatic events of the coup will mean that the radio and television services will have a particularly attentive and receptive audience</li>
<li>In broad­ casting over the radio and television services our purpose is not to provide information about the situation but rather to affect its development by <b>exploiting our monopoly of these media</b></li>
<li>We will have two principal objectives in the information campaign that will start immediately after the coup
<ul>
<li><b>To discourage resistance</b> to us by emphasizing the strength of our position</li>
<li><b>To dampen the fears</b> which would otherwise give rise to such resistance</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Our first objective will be achieved by <mark class="highlighted">conveying the reality and strength of the coup instead of trying to justify it</mark>
<ul>
<li>This will be done by listing the controls we have imposed, by emphasizing that law and order have been fully restored, and by stating that all resistance has ceased</li>
<li>In these circumstances the news of any resistance against us would act as a powerful stimulant to further resistance by breaking down this feeling of isolation. We must therefore make every effort to withhold such news. If there is in fact some resistance and if its intensity and locale are such as to make it difficult to conceal from particular segments of the public, we should admit its existence; but we should strongly emphasize that it is isolated, the product of the obstinacy of a few mis­ guided or dishonest individuals who are not affiliated to any party or group of significant membership</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The second objective of our information campaign will be to <mark class="highlighted">reassure the general public by dispelling fears that the coup is inspired by foreign and /or extremist elements, and to persuade particular interest groups that the coup is not a threat to them</mark></li>
<li>The flow of information emanating from all the sources under our control should be coordinated with our other measures: the impositions of physical controls will be announced and explained, and the political moves, to which we now turn, will be suitably presented.</li>
<li>Physical coercion will deter or defeat direct opposition, while the information campaign will lay the basis of our eventual acquisition of authority, but <mark class="highlighted">only political means will secure for us a base of active support</mark>
<ul>
<li>Where the pre-coup regime was exceptionally brutal, corrupt, or retrograde, the leaders of the coup will have little trouble in gaining a generalized form of acceptance, but even then the active support of specific groups can only be gained by political accommodation, i.e. by sponsoring policies which serve the interests of particular groups, thus giving them reasons for becoming committed to (or at least interested in) our survival
<ul>
<li>The backing of one interest group will generally have as its concomitant the loss of support of—or even actual hostility from— other groups</li>
<li>In the context of a Latin American post-coup situation, for example, the good will of remote and dispersed peasants will not help us much against the immediate and powerful opposition of bureaucratic and military cadres who could for the most part be the children of the landowning aristocracy</li>
<li>If, on the other hand, our short-term position is strong but we are threatened by a longer-term usurpation of power on the part of our military allies, our objective will be to create a counter­ weight capable eventually of becoming a source of direct strength, such as a peasants' militia</li>
<li>Thus whether we opt for a “left" policy of land reform and longer-term campesino support or a "right" policy of peasant repression and immediate landowner support will depend on the balance between the strength of our short- and our long-term positions</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>One element in our strategy after the coup lies halfway between the information campaign and the political campaign: <mark class="highlighted">the problem of “legitimizing" the coup</mark>
<ul>
<li>Clearly the coup is by definition illegal, but whether this illegality matters, and whether it is possible to counteract its effects, will depend on the total political environment of the country in question</li>
<li>Where the head of state is not nominal, as in “presidential” regimes, other tactics will have to be used: the announcement of forthcoming elections or a referendum (as a sort of ex post facto legitimization) or, alternatively, the coup can be openly admitted as an extraconstitutional intervention, but one made against an unconstitutional regime
<ul>
<li>One illegality will then be represented as being the cause of the other, but we shall declare that whereas the illegality of the pre­ coup regime was voluntary and permanent, ours is necessary and temporary</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>One particular problem requires further exploration: <mark class="highlighted">recognition by foreign powers.</mark>
<ul>
<li>Diplomatic recognition is one of the elements in the general process of establishing the authority of the new government; until this is achieved, we will have to rely on the brittle instruments of physical coercion and our position will be vulnerable to many threats— including that of Coup d’état</li>
