for an existing, commercially released game.</li>\n<li>Analyzing what has already been released for the game and deriving a mathematical model to describe the relationship between the costs and benefits of the various game objects (in other words, how the costs of everything in the game are determined, based on how powerful they are and what they do for you).</li>\n<li>Create an original mechanic of your own design that does not yet exist in the game, tentatively come up for what it costs based on the analysis you did and your intuition, and then create a small number (five to ten) of new game objects that showcase your new mechanic.</li>\n</ul><br>\n<hr><br>\n<ul>\n<li>Start now by choosing a game with relatively simple systems in one of the following genres:\n<ul>\n<li>TCG, LCG (Living Card Game), deck building game, miniatures game, or a tabletop RPG (role-playing game) that has combat resolution rules.</li>\n<li>If you prefer video games, choose a TBS (turn-based strategy) or RTS (real-time strategy) computer game that has mod tools, such that you can modify the numbers and capabilities of various units.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Identify game objects that are clearly

Action cards all have some Power requirements; you must have at least that many Power in play in order to use that Action card.</li>\n<li>An Action card might require specific types of Power or “generic” Power that can be any type, or some combination of the two.\n<ul>\n<li>A card might require 2 Bio+2 Generic, which could be satisfied by having 4 Bio in play, or 2 Bio and 2 Magic, or any other combination of at least four Power where at least two are Bio.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>A player’s turn is divided into three steps: Draw, Power, and Action. If they have not yet won the game, it then becomes the opponent’s turn, and this continues until one player loses. The steps are as follows:\n<ul>\n<li><b>Draw phase</b>: the player draws two cards from their deck.</li>\n<li><b>Power phase</b>: either the player can play one Power card from their hand into play, or if they can’t or choose not to, then they must discard one card from their hand to their discard pile.</li>\n<li><b>Action phase</b>: the player can either play one Action card for which they meet the Power requirement of all of their own Power cards in play, or else they must discard one card from their hand to their discard pile.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Action cards can perform some combination of the game’s four core mechanics:\n<ul>\n<li><b>Damage</b>: for each point of damage done to the opponent, take the top card of their draw pile and move it to their discard pile.</li>\n<li><b>Healing</b>: for each point of healing, take the top card of your discard pile and put it on the bottom of your draw pile. If there are fewer cards in your discard pile than the amount of healing, move all that you can and ignore the rest (for example, if your discard pile has seven cards and you Heal 9, move all seven cards to the bottom of your deck and the remaining 2 are ignored).</li>\n<li><b>Draw</b>: for each point of draw, take the top card of your draw pile and put it in your hand.</li>\n<li><b>Discard</b>: for each point of discard, the opponent must choose and discard one card in their hand to their discard pile.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>For example, a card that says “Damage 5, Draw 4” means you draw four cards from your own deck, and the opponent takes the top five cards from their deck and put them in their discard pile.</li>\n<li>Play each deck against the others (this is at least six games total: Deck A vs. B, A vs. C, A vs. D, B vs. C, B vs. D, and C vs. D).</li>\n<li>By then, you should be comfortable with the rules and core mechanics and have a general sense of how powerful Damage, Healing, Draw, and Discard are relative to one another.</li>\n<li>As it is, you’ll find the game to be heavily unbalanced. Each of the four mechanics is costed similarly, even though they have drastically different value in play, as you’ll see when you play. For now, just make a mental note of which of the decks and which of the mechanics seems the most and least powerful.

If balancing the starters, you can only make the following modifications to the starter decks, and no other changes:</li>\n<li>Modify the cost of an Action card (keeping the same Power types in the cost and only modifying how much Power is required to play it, as you did in Part 3).\n<ul>\n<li>Note that most cards appear in several decks, so modify- ing the cost of a card in one deck means you have to change the cost of that card in all other decks that it appears in.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Modify the number of each type of Power card in the deck. Each deck has two Power types, so you can swap one for the other directly, or you can add extra Power cards of either type by removing an equal number of Action cards, or you can remove Power cards and add extra copies of any Action card that is already in the game (whether it was formerly part of that deck or not).\n<ul>\n<li>Note that this means you cannot change the effects of any Action cards, create new Action cards with your own effects, or change the total number of cards in a deck (all decks must remain the same size).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><b>Hint</b>: Note that you are balancing decks, not individual cards. While you can certainly attempt to make every individual card balanced against every other card, you can also have some cards that are clearly above the curve, if the rest of the deck is weaker than average otherwise, for example.<br></li>\n<li><b>If balancing the cards</b>: assume a constructed-deck environment, where players can make their own decks using whatever cards they want from the list of cards supplied in the four starters (assume all decks must be exactly 50 cards, with a maximum of three copies of any Action card, but otherwise no restrictions). In such a format, each individual card must be balanced against the other cards on the same cost curve.</li>\n<li>Make an attempt to balance the cards against one another, using the spreadsheets and any other tools you have developed for this game so far. As before, you can modify the power costs of Action cards but cannot alter the power type(s), nor the effects of playing the cards, nor the core rules of the game.</li>\n<li>You do not have to playtest your attempt yet—that is coming in the next part—but just make a good-faith first-run attempt on paper for now, updating your prototype accordingly.</li>\n</ul><br>\n<h3 id='After learning about Metagame system'>After learning about Metagame system</h3><ul>\n<li>Design a complete ranking and/or rating system for Harmony.</li>\n<li>Justify your decisions in the design.

for an existing, commercially released game.</li>\n<li>Analyzing what has already been released for the game and deriving a mathematical model to describe the relationship between the costs and benefits of the various game objects (in other words, how the costs of everything in the game are determined, based on how powerful they are and what they do for you).</li>\n<li>Create an original mechanic of your own design that does not yet exist in the game, tentatively come up for what it costs based on the analysis you did and your intuition, and then create a small number (five to ten) of new game objects that showcase your new mechanic.</li>\n</ul><br>\n<hr><br>\n<ul>\n<li>Start now by choosing a game with relatively simple systems in one of the following genres:\n<ul>\n<li>TCG, LCG (Living Card Game), deck building game, miniatures game, or a tabletop RPG (role-playing game) that has combat resolution rules.</li>\n<li>If you prefer video games, choose a TBS (turn-based strategy) or RTS (real-time strategy) computer game that has mod tools, such that you can modify the numbers and capabilities of various units.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Identify game objects that are clearly overpowered, others that are clearly underpowered, and others that feel “just right” as ideal paragons of balance. You will be using these later to construct and test your own mathematical models, to make sure that your math identifies the most broken objects as such.\n<ul>\n<li>If you are very familiar with the game, you may do this using just your own experience and intuition. Otherwise, you may wish to supplement by looking online for strategy articles, player or developer forums, or similar sources to see what the player community has identified.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul><br>\n<h3 id='After leaning Curves'>After leaning Curves</h3><ul>\n<li>List all of the resources in the game state that you can think of.\n<ul>\n<li>In a card game, this might involve the resources used to put cards into play (mana, gold, etc.), cards in hand (or in a draw deck or in a discard pile), life points or victory points.</li>\n<li>In a turn-based or real-time strategy game, this might include resource units (gold, oil, or whatever is used to bring more units into play), military or other units in play, structures and upgrades, advancement along a tech tree, and so on.</li>\n<li>For a tabletop miniatures game, these are usually not resource-heavy you’d be thinking of your units, individual units’ health, and combat stats (defense to improve survivability, attack to remove opponents’ units from play).</li>\n<li>In a tabletop RPG, you might consider currency, experience points/levels, player stats, and health/hit points.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Identify the relationships between resources.\n<ul>\n<li>Can some resources be converted to others, either by the core mechanics of the game or by the special rules of a specific game object?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Express the resource flow of the game through a diagram. You might use a diagramming language like <b>Machinations</b> or just a manual diagram of boxes and arrows drawn by hand or in a computer program.</li>\n</ul><br>\n<h3 id='After learning Cost Curves'>After learning Cost Curves</h3><ul>\n<li>Identify some subset of the game’s mechanics and game objects that are meaningful within a relatively self-contained system.\n<ul>\n<li>For a CCG or similar card game, this might be a particular class of cards</li>\n<li>In a turn-based or real-time strategy game or tabletop miniatures game, consider the combat units of the game</li>\n<li>Tabletop RPG, you might look at item and equipment lists, or a list of spells or feats or other capabilities.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>There should be enough material to be able to find similarities and patterns, but not so much material to sort through that it becomes unwield.\n<ul>\n<li>About 30-60 items after remove unique items that can’t be compared with anything else</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Derive the cost curve and supporting math for these objects, as best you can.

Action cards all have some Power requirements; you must have at least that many Power in play in order to use that Action card.</li>\n<li>An Action card might require specific types of Power or “generic” Power that can be any type, or some combination of the two.\n<ul>\n<li>A card might require 2 Bio+2 Generic, which could be satisfied by having 4 Bio in play, or 2 Bio and 2 Magic, or any other combination of at least four Power where at least two are Bio.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>A player’s turn is divided into three steps: Draw, Power, and Action. If they have not yet won the game, it then becomes the opponent’s turn, and this continues until one player loses. The steps are as follows:\n<ul>\n<li><b>Draw phase</b>: the player draws two cards from their deck.</li>\n<li><b>Power phase</b>: either the player can play one Power card from their hand into play, or if they can’t or choose not to, then they must discard one card from their hand to their discard pile.</li>\n<li><b>Action phase</b>: the player can either play one Action card for which they meet the Power requirement of all of their own Power cards in play, or else they must discard one card from their hand to their discard pile.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Action cards can perform some combination of the game’s four core mechanics:\n<ul>\n<li><b>Damage</b>: for each point of damage done to the opponent, take the top card of their draw pile and move it to their discard pile.</li>\n<li><b>Healing</b>: for each point of healing, take the top card of your discard pile and put it on the bottom of your draw pile. If there are fewer cards in your discard pile than the amount of healing, move all that you can and ignore the rest (for example, if your discard pile has seven cards and you Heal 9, move all seven cards to the bottom of your deck and the remaining 2 are ignored).</li>\n<li><b>Draw</b>: for each point of draw, take the top card of your draw pile and put it in your hand.</li>\n<li><b>Discard</b>: for each point of discard, the opponent must choose and discard one card in their hand to their discard pile.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>For example, a card that says “Damage 5, Draw 4” means you draw four cards from your own deck, and the opponent takes the top five cards from their deck and put them in their discard pile.</li>\n<li>Play each deck against the others (this is at least six games total: Deck A vs. B, A vs. C, A vs. D, B vs. C, B vs. D, and C vs. D).</li>\n<li>By then, you should be comfortable with the rules and core mechanics and have a general sense of how powerful Damage, Healing, Draw, and Discard are relative to one another.</li>\n<li>As it is, you’ll find the game to be heavily unbalanced. Each of the four mechanics is costed similarly, even though they have drastically different value in play, as you’ll see when you play. For now, just make a mental note of which of the decks and which of the mechanics seems the most and least powerful. You may want to take some written notes to this effect as well, so you can refer back to them in later parts.</li>\n</ul><br>\n<h3 id='After learning Cost Curves'>After learning Cost Curves</h3><ul>\n<li>From playing Harmony, you should have a general sense of which of the</li>\n</ul><br>\n<p>four mechanics (Heal, Damage, Draw, and Discard) is most or least powerful, and whether there is a law of increasing or diminishing returns with each</p><ul>\n<li>Is “Discard 3” three times as good as “Discard 1”… or more or less than that?</li>\n<li>You should also have an idea of what the cost curve looks like:</li>\n<li>Does something that costs 4 Power give twice as powerful an effect as something that costs 2 Power?</li>\n<li>Does increasing Power requirement scale linearly with the benefit, or is it a polynomial or triangular increase, a logarithmic increase, or some other type of curve (or a custom curve that behaves differently at various points and doesn’t fit a single equation)?</li>\n<li>What is the relationship between Power of specific types (Bio, Gear, Magic, or Science) and Generic Power— how many Generic are worth one specific?</li>\n<li>Make an attempt to develop a cost curve and supporting math for these four mechanics, based on your sense of their general power levels.</li>\n<li>Create a spreadsheet with columns for each of the four specific Power types and a fifth for Generic Power, and then four columns for Heal, Damage, Draw, and Discard.

That is, assuming equal player skill, either player should be able to play any two decks against one another and each player/deck should have as close to a 50% chance of winning as possible. If balancing the starters, you can only make the following modifications to the starter decks, and no other changes:</li>\n<li>Modify the cost of an Action card (keeping the same Power types in the cost and only modifying how much Power is required to play it, as you did in Part 3).\n<ul>\n<li>Note that most cards appear in several decks, so modify- ing the cost of a card in one deck means you have to change the cost of that card in all other decks that it appears in.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Modify the number of each type of Power card in the deck. Each deck has two Power types, so you can swap one for the other directly, or you can add extra Power cards of either type by removing an equal number of Action cards, or you can remove Power cards and add extra copies of any Action card that is already in the game (whether it was formerly part of that deck or not).\n<ul>\n<li>Note that this means you cannot change the effects of any Action cards, create new Action cards with your own effects, or change the total number of cards in a deck (all decks must remain the same size).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><b>Hint</b>: Note that you are balancing decks, not individual cards. While you can certainly attempt to make every individual card balanced against every other card, you can also have some cards that are clearly above the curve, if the rest of the deck is weaker than average otherwise, for example.<br></li>\n<li><b>If balancing the cards</b>: assume a constructed-deck environment, where players can make their own decks using whatever cards they want from the list of cards supplied in the four starters (assume all decks must be exactly 50 cards, with a maximum of three copies of any Action card, but otherwise no restrictions). In such a format, each individual card must be balanced against the other cards on the same cost curve.</li>\n<li>Make an attempt to balance the cards against one another, using the spreadsheets and any other tools you have developed for this game so far.
