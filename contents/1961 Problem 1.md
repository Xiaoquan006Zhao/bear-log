## Solution

* If a = 0, then b =0, from equation (2), it’s derived that x, y, z are all 0 which violates the condition that they have to be positive numbers
* If a ≠ 0, then we proceed:

* Apply Vieta's formulas, we can obtain another equation with the same root of x and y.

* In order for the root of the new equation to exist and be distinct, the [discriminant](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Discriminant) of the equation has to be strictly positive.

* From (1) and given conditions for x, y, and z; we know **==x>0, y>0, z>0, a>0==**
* Substitute a>0 into the previous derivation we had for z, we know **==a^2 > b^2==**
