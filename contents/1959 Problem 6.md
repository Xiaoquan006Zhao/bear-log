## Insight
### Tangent Segment Theorem
* if two tangent lines are drawn from a single external point to a circle, then the tangent segments are congruent
* Because the two triangles are congruent (the circle’s radius is the same length and the two triangles share the hypotenuse)

### Pitot's Theorem for Tangential Quadrilaterals
* From Tangent Segment Theorem, we know each of the colored segments are equal length
* Then, we know **the sum of one pair of opposite sides is equal to the sum of the other pair of opposite sides**

## Solution
* Find two parallel line AB and line CD that are in plane P and plane Q respectively.
  * We know plane P and plane Q intersect at line p.
  * Thus if line AB and line CD are both parallel to line p, we show AB and CD are parallel as well. 
  * And since line p lies in both planes, we know line AB and line CD are plane P and plane Q respectively.
* From condition, we know a circle can be inscribed in the trapezoid ABCD. We can apply Pitot's Theorem for Tangential Quadrilaterals, obtain that top+base = leg+leg. (Two legs are equal length because the trapezoid is isosceles)
* Then, leg = 0.5*(top+base)
* Nest, we need a way to find 0.5*(top+base)
