## Part (a)
### Solution
![](1959%20Problem%205/image%207.png)
* ∠NCD = ∠NBA
* ∠NCD + ∠DCM = 90 + ∠NBA
* ∠MCB = 90 - ∠NBA
* ∠NCD + ∠DCM + ∠MCB = 180
* Shows N, C, B are collinear

* ∠FCN = ∠MCB (since N, C, B are collinear)
* ∠MCB = ∠FAM (congruent triangles)
* ∠FAM + ∠AFM = 90
* ∠FCN + ∠AFM = 90
* ∠FCN + ∠AFM + ∠FNC = 180
* ∠FNC = 90
* Since N, C, B are collinear, We know △ANB is a triangle 
* Since the △AFM, △CBM are congruent, the ∠AFM, ∠CBM are congruent; hence ∠ANB = 90
* ∠FNC + ∠ANB = 180
* Shows F, N, A are collinear 

* Which shows that AF and BC, intersects at N. (N’ and N coincide)

### Solution

* Since ∠ANB is a right angle, N lies on the circle. (Due to Inscribed Angle Theorem)
  * Since AB is diameter (center angle 180), thus an angle inscribe the same arc must be 90 degrees. And inscribed angle must be on the circle.
